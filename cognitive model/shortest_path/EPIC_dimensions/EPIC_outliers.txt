P26_11:
	- small environment, narrow x dimension (1,3m)
	- high variation in z dimension (overhead cupboards, low cupboards, midlevel)
	- many items with same cost for first item
	- y/xy/yz nearly identical prediction error -> mostly y relevant?

P24_05:
	- small environment, narrow x dimension (1,6m)
	- some variation in x and z dimension -> therefore combination highest explanatory power?
	- yz/xyz -> nearly no difference in prediction error
	- x irrelevant?

P22_12:
	- small environment, narrow x dimension (1,2m)
	- food preparation before table setting, all objects already on counter top (same coordinates)
	- y/xy -> adding x increases prediction error
	- z irrelevant because of item placement?

P01_01:
	- low variance on y dimension (all items nearly next to each other)
	- low variance on z dimension (all items at nearly same height)
	- table setting in one sequence (no in-between actions)
	- xz/xyz identical -> y irrelevant?

P01_03:
	- variation in x,y,z (item location)
	- x/xy nearly identical, lowest error for xz -> y irrelevant?
